# ThreeMatch
Simple Match Three Game

Built this using C++ and SDL2. Was a project I worked on during a weekend. I had no prior knowledge to SDL2 when I started this project.

Has the following implemented:
- 10 by 10 Grid
- 3 Random gem colours
- Gems fall down when removed
- Type matcing
- On screen score
- 10 moves until the game ends
- Set 3 or more starting pairs
- 1 point per gem removed

Dependancies:
 - SDL2
 - SDL2_image-2.0.5
 - SDL_ttf-main-2.0.14
